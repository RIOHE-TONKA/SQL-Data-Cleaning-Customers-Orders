Cleaning Tasks You Can Try:
1. Standardize customer names: Capitalize and trim. -----------------------------------------DONE
2. Fix inconsistent product names: Normalize case (e.g., LAPTOP â†’ Laptop).-------------------DONE
3. Clean phone numbers: Remove special characters and ensure consistent formatting.----------DONE
4. Fix email issues: Correct obvious typos (e.g., maria@@email.com) and missing fields.------DONE
5. Correct date formats: Convert 02/16/2024 to 2024-02-16.-----------------------------------DONE
6. Check data types: Ensure price, total, and quantity are numeric.--------------------------DONE
7. Calculate missing or incorrect totals: Recalculate total = price * quantity.-------------- THATS FINE
8. Remove or flag duplicates: Based on order_id, customer_name, and order_date.
9. Handle NULLs and blanks appropriately.
10. Flag or correct negative quantities and totals.-----------------------------------------DONE*/
